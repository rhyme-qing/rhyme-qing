### Hi there

I am a full-stack developer with a focus on project analysis and design, using various technologies to bring my designs and initial ideas to life. I have previously held positions in graphic design, network security, research assistant (social sciences), front-end, back-end, and blockchain development.

Currently, I am researching the feasibility of non-profit networks, neutrality of social science databases, and natural language processing systems. 

Additionally, I am learning Go, Rust and Elixir to be used in implementing my non-profit network.

If you have an interest in non-profit networks, you can visit NPO.NETWORK to join us.
You can contact me via email at rhyme@npo.network
